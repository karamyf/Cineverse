# Cineverse
A mobile application built with React Native that allows users to search for movies and get details about each movie, including ratings, plot summaries, and release dates. The app utilizes the OMDB API to fetch data and display it in a user-friendly interface. Users can also save their favorite movies to a watchlist for easy access later.
